Description: This Shiny app is geared toward strength and conditioning professionals and researchers
  who can't afford vertical jump analysis software and those who don't have the coding knowledge to
  design their own analyses. It's my hope these individuals will have an alternative to analyzing their
  force-time data in Excel (we've all been there). This allows for more power analysis than just simply
  jump height, peak force, etc. Additionally, this app is publicly available to take the cover off the black
  box that is force-time data analysis. A consistent set of filtering, plotting, and variable calculation functions
  allow for consistent analysis procedures between users. Importantly, this app is only designed to analyze data 
  from dual PASCO force plates. Users are welcome to create forks that are compatible with other force platforms.
